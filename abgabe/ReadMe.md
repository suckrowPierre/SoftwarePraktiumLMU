# Roborally - Pragmatische Pinguine

## How to start the game:
- Please have jdk-version 17.0.1 installed.
- The jars can be started on Windows by using the command "java -jar \<filename\>.jar"
- MacOS or Linux users might need a different version of javafx. They need to add the path to their own javafx folder. E.g.: "java --module-path "/path/to/javafx-sdk-17.0.1/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar \<filename\>.jar"
- Start a server on a chosen port and choose the minimum number of players.
- Then start your client(s) by entering the ip and port of your server.
Selecting the AI checkbox will connect an AI to the server. If you click on it you need to start another client to play yourself.
The version at the bottom should be left as is. It makes it possible to connect to servers with older versions.
- After connecting successfully, choose your robot and name. The lobby will open and the first player to select "Ready" will get to choose a map. After all players are ready the game will begin.

Purchased upgrades will appear on the right of your programming cards.

Memory Swap will require that you drag and drop three handcards into the gray box on the bottom right to dispose of them. Then click "Send".
- **Permanent Upgrades** will always be active. You do not need to activate them.
To send your admin privilege selection choose a register and don't forget to click "send".
- **Programming Phase**: Drag and drop your cards from the nine handcards on the left into the five slots on the left below them.
You can drag them back to empty slots in your handcards if you make a mistake.
